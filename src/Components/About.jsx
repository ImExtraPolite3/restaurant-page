      <h2>About the owner</h2>
      <p>
        At the heart of our restaurant is a passion for authentic Italian
        cuisine, passed down through generations. Our owner, Johnny, grew up in
        a small village in Tuscany, where family and food were the pillars of
        life. Bringing those traditions to La Bella Cucina, he is dedicated to
        creating a warm, welcoming atmosphere where guests can enjoy the simple
        pleasures of Italian cooking, just like back home.
